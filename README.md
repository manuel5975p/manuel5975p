## Hello there
I'm a C/C++ and computer graphics enthusiast who likes creating portable and powerful graphics libraries.

Unfortunately the days of using OpenGL / WebGL everywhere are over, since
- WebGL2 / OpenGL ES 3 lacks crucial features, such as Compute Shaders and Storage Buffers
- Apple has deprecated OpenGL at version 4.1 and will likely drop support completely in the near future.

Currently I'm working mainly on two projects:
- [WGVK](https://github.com/manuel5975p/WGVK): A single-file, complete and performant implementation of the WebGPU spec on Vulkan 1.1 in pure C.
- [RayGPU](https://github.com/manuel5975p/raygpu/): A raylib reimplementation on WebGPU / Vulkan
